4. `PUT /api/player-matches/{id}` - Update player match
5. `GET /api/team-matches/{id}/player-matches` - List player matches
6. `POST /api/player-matches/{id}/games` - Record game result
7. `GET /api/player-matches/{id}/games` - Get game history

#### Authentication Enhancement
- **Dual Authentication**: JWT tokens for users, API secrets for admin tools
- **Attribute-Based Security**: `[RequiresApiSecret]` and `[RequiresUserAuth]` attributes
- **Middleware Integration**: Extended existing authentication pipeline

### Frontend Implementation (Jekyll + JavaScript)

#### User Interface Pages (5 total)
1. **team-match-detail.html**: Team match overview with player matches grid
2. **player-match-detail.html**: Individual match view with game history
3. **player-match-create.html**: Player match creation form
4. **player-match-edit.html**: Player match editing interface
5. **game-recording.html**: Real-time game recording interface

#### JavaScript Architecture
- **match-api.js**: Centralized API utilities module

### Database Schema Extensions

#### Enhanced Models
- **TeamMatch**: Added scoring totals and aggregation fields
- **PlayerMatch**: New entity for player-vs-player contests
- **Game**: Individual rack results with points and winners
- **MatchStatus**: Enum for match lifecycle management

#### Cosmos DB Strategy
- **Partition Key**: All entities use `/divisionId` for optimal performance
- **Document Design**: JSON documents with nested scoring summaries
- **Consistency**: Strong consistency for scoring operations
