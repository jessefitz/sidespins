# SideSpins Authorization System Implementation â€” Phases 1 & 2 âœ… Complete

---

## Phase 1: Backend Infrastructure & Core Services âœ…

### 1.1 Data Model Transformation

**Files Modified:** `AuthModels.cs`, `LeagueModels.cs`

* **Lean JWT Implementation**: Transformed from team-embedded JWTs to **identity-only tokens** containing just `UserId`, `SidespinsRole`, and timestamps.
* **Player Model Enhancement**: Added `PhoneNumber` property to support phone-based reconciliation during signup.
* **AppClaims Simplification**: Removed team-specific claims from JWT payload, moving to **per-request authorization**.
* **UserTeamMembership Record**: Created lightweight record for middleware use without full `TeamMembership` entity overhead.
* **Signup Flow Models**: Added `SignupInitRequest`, `SignupInitResponse`, and `UserProfile` for APA-first onboarding.
* **Stytch Integration Models**: Updated `StytchUserTrustedMetadata` to extract only `sidespins_role` from trusted metadata.

---

### 1.2 Membership Service Infrastructure

**New Files:** `IMembershipService.cs`, `CosmosMembershipService.cs`

* **Service Abstraction**: Clean interface for membership queries with testable contracts.
* **Cosmos DB Integration**: Implemented efficient querying against `TeamMemberships` container with proper error handling.
* **Performance Optimization**: Lightweight `UserTeamMembership` conversion from full entities.
* **Container Configuration**: Configurable container targeting via environment variables (`COSMOS_MEMBERSHIPS_CONTAINER`).
* **Role Hierarchy Support**: Built-in understanding of `player < manager < admin` role precedence.

---

### 1.3 Team-Scoped Authorization System

**New File:** `RequireTeamRoleAttribute.cs`

* **Declarative Authorization**: Attribute-based authorization for Azure Functions endpoints.
* **Route Parameter Integration**: Automatic extraction of `teamId` from route parameters or request body.
* **Minimum Role Enforcement**: Configurable role requirements (`player`, `manager`, `admin`).
* **Flexible Team Context**: Support for both route-based and header-based team selection.

---

### 1.4 Authentication Service Overhaul

**Files Modified:** `AuthService.cs`

* **JWT Generation**: Lean token creation with identity claims only.
* **Stytch Integration**: Enhanced OTP authentication with proper error handling.
* **Token Validation**: Updated validation logic for new JWT structure.
* **Trusted Metadata Extraction**: Automated `sidespins_role` extraction from Stytch user metadata.
* **Phone Reconciliation**: Integration with player lookup for signup flow.

---

### 1.5 Middleware Architecture

**Files Modified:** `AuthenticationMiddleware.cs`, `FunctionContextExtensions.cs`

* **Per-Request Authorization**: Team membership resolution on each authenticated request.
* **Context Extensions**: Clean API for accessing user context and team memberships in functions.
* **Error Handling**: Standardized **401/403** responses with descriptive error messages.
* **Performance Caching**: Request-scoped caching of membership data to avoid duplicate queries.

---

### 1.6 API Endpoints Implementation

**Files Modified:** `AuthFunctions.cs`, `MembershipFunctions.cs`

* **APA-First Signup**: `POST /auth/signup/init` â€” validates APA number before Stytch authentication.
* **User Profile**: `GET /me/profile` â€” returns user identity and global role.
* **Team Memberships**: `GET /me/memberships` â€” returns all active team memberships with roles.
* **Phone Reconciliation**: Automatic linking of phone numbers to existing players during signup.

---

## Phase 2: Frontend Integration & User Experience âœ…

### 2.1 Signup Flow Transformation

**Files Modified:** `login.html`, `assets/auth.js`

* **APA-First UX**: Two-step signup process (APA validation â†’ Stytch OTP).
* **Input Validation**: Client-side validation for APA numbers and phone format.
* **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages for invalid APA numbers or phone conflicts.
* **Progressive Enhancement**: Maintains backward compatibility while adding new flow.

---

### 2.2 Authentication Manager Overhaul

**Files Modified:** `assets/auth.js`

* **Team Context Management**: Active team tracking with localStorage persistence.
* **Role-Based Authorization**: Client-side role checking for UI conditional rendering.
* **Token Management**: Lean JWT handling with automatic renewal.
* **API Integration**: Seamless integration with new backend endpoints.
* **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of **403** responses and team context errors.

---

### 2.3 Team Switcher Component

**Files Modified:** `app.html`

* **Header Integration**: Dropdown team selector in main navigation.
* **Dynamic Loading**: Automatic population from userâ€™s team memberships.
* **Role Display**: Visual indication of userâ€™s role in selected team.
* **Context Persistence**: Maintains team selection across page refreshes.
* **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly team switching interface.

---

### 2.4 Conditional UI Framework

**Files Modified:** `app.html`

* **Role-Based Rendering**: Show/hide UI elements based on userâ€™s role in active team.
* **Authorization Helpers**: JavaScript utilities for checking permissions.
* **Action Guards**: Prevents unauthorized actions before API calls.
* **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication when features are unavailable due to permissions.

---

## Technical Architecture Improvements

### Dependency Injection & Configuration

**File:** `Program.cs`

* **Service Registration**: Proper DI container setup for all services.
* **Environment Configuration**: Secure configuration management for all environments.
* **HTTP Client Management**: Proper `HttpClient` lifecycle management for Stytch API.
* **Cosmos Client Optimization**: Singleton `CosmosClient` with optimal serialization settings.

---

### Security Enhancements

* **JWT Signing**: Secure key management for token signing/validation.
* **CORS Configuration**: Environment-based CORS setup for local development.
* **API Key Security**: All sensitive keys managed via environment variables.
* **Authentication Middleware**: Consistent security enforcement across all protected endpoints.

---

### Performance & Scalability

* **Connection Pooling**: Reused HTTP and Cosmos connections.
* **Async Patterns**: Consistent `async/await` usage throughout.
* **Lightweight Serialization**: Optimized JSON handling with camelCase conversion.
* **Request-Scoped Caching**: Efficient membership data caching within request lifecycle.

---

## Testing & Validation âœ…

* **API Testing**: PowerShell scripts for endpoint validation (`test-api.ps1`).
* **Local Development**: Full local testing environment with Azure Functions Core Tools.
* **Data Validation**: Confirmed working with real Cosmos DB data (*Brian D â€” APA #21229808*).
* **Frontend Integration**: Complete signup and team switching flow validation.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Final Outcome

The **authorization system transformation is complete** with both backend infrastructure and frontend integration fully implemented and tested.

* Migrated from **monolithic, team-embedded JWTs** â†’ to a **flexible, per-request authorization model**.
* Enabled **clean team context switching** with secure, lean tokens.
* Improved UX, security, and maintainability while preparing for scale.
