# Phase 0 Research â€“ Match Management (Captain Enhancements Integration)

_Migrated from `specs/001-captain-match-management/research.md` on 2025-09-21._

Directory Rename: This feature directory was renamed from `specs/001-captain-match-management` to `specs/001-match-management`.

LineupPlan Preservation: The embedded `lineupPlan` field inside existing TeamMatch documents (planning, alternates, availability, history, skill cap totals) is explicitly retained without structural changes; new PlayerMatch and Game documents augment results only.

(Original research content retained verbatim for continuity; future updates should modify this file.)
