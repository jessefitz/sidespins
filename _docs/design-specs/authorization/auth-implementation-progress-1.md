# Phase 1 Authorization System Implementation ‚Äî ‚úÖ Completed

## ‚úÖ Phase 1 Implementation Complete

### What We've Implemented

#### ‚úÖ Updated Core Data Models (`AuthModels.cs` & `LeagueModels.cs`)

* Transformed **AppClaims** to use lean JWT structure (identity + timestamps only).
* Updated **StytchUserTrustedMetadata** to extract `sidespins_role` instead of team data.
* Added `PhoneNumber` property to **Player** model.
* Created new models for APA-first signup flow:

  * `SignupInitRequest`
  * `SignupInitResponse`
  * `UserTeamMembershipInfo`
  * `UserProfile`
* Added lightweight **UserTeamMembership** record for middleware use.

#### ‚úÖ Created Membership Service Infrastructure

* `IMembershipService` interface for clean abstraction.
* `CosmosMembershipService` implementation with Cosmos DB integration.
* Efficient querying of team memberships for authorization.

#### ‚úÖ Created Team Role Authorization Attribute

* `RequireTeamRoleAttribute` for declarative team-scoped authorization.
* Configurable minimum role requirements and route parameter extraction.

#### ‚úÖ Updated AuthService for Lean JWTs

* Modified JWT generation to include only **identity claims**.
* Updated JWT validation to work with new lean format.
* Extracts `sidespins_role` from **Stytch trusted metadata**.

#### ‚úÖ Overhauled Authentication Middleware

* Support for both **RequireAuthentication** and **RequireTeamRole** attributes.
* Team membership validation via `IMembershipService`.
* Role hierarchy enforcement with **global admin bypass**.
* Proper **401 vs 403** error handling.

#### ‚úÖ Updated Dependency Injection

* Registered `IMembershipService` and `CosmosMembershipService` in **Program.cs**.

#### ‚úÖ Implemented APA-First Signup Flow

* New `POST /auth/signup/init` endpoint in **AuthFunctions.cs**.
* APA number validation against **Players** collection.
* Phone number reconciliation.
* Active membership resolution for team switcher.
* Integration with **Stytch SMS OTP**.

#### ‚úÖ Created Membership Management Functions

* `GET /me/memberships` endpoint for team switcher.
* `GET /me/profile` endpoint for user profile data.

#### ‚úÖ Updated Function Authorization Patterns

* Demonstrated new **RequireTeamRole** usage in sample functions.
* Updated existing functions to work with lean JWT structure.

## Key Benefits Achieved

* üîê **Security**: Team authorization now happens **server-side on every request** using authoritative data from `TeamMemberships`.
* üéØ **Lean JWTs**: Tokens are minimal and focused on identity only, no team data.
* üõ°Ô∏è **APA-First Onboarding**: Only verified APA members can create accounts.
* üîÑ **Team Context Flexibility**: Users can switch between teams dynamically.
* üì± **Phone Reconciliation**: Automatic phone number updates during signup.
* ‚ö° **Performance Ready**: Clean architecture prepared for future Redis caching.

## What's Working Now

* ‚úÖ JWT generation and validation with lean claims.
* ‚úÖ Team membership queries via Cosmos DB.
* ‚úÖ Role-based authorization middleware.
* ‚úÖ APA-first signup flow with phone reconciliation.
* ‚úÖ Membership listing for team switcher UI.
* ‚úÖ Function-level team role requirements.

## Next Steps for Frontend Implementation

The backend infrastructure is now ready. **Phase 2** is focused on frontend updates:

1. **Update Frontend Signup Flow**

   * Modify `login.html` and `auth.js` to use the new APA-first flow.

2. **Implement Team Switcher**

   * Add header component with team selection dropdown.

3. **Add Conditional UI**

   * Show/hide features based on team roles.

4. **Handle 403 Responses**

   * Gracefully handle insufficient permissions.
