# Whatâ€™s Left to Complete Authorization Requirements

Accurate as-of implementation progress updates 1 and 2.

---

## 1. Enhanced Error Handling & User Experience ðŸ”§

**Missing:** Comprehensive **403 error handling** and user feedback.

### Code Sample â€” Enhanced 403 Handling

*Add to `AuthenticationMiddleware.cs`*

```csharp
// Enhanced error responses for authorization failures
public class AuthorizationErrorResponse
{
    public string Error { get; set; }
    public string Message { get; set; }
    public string RequiredRole { get; set; }
    public string UserRole { get; set; }
    public string TeamId { get; set; }
    public List<string> AvailableActions { get; set; }
}
```

This enables more actionable feedback to the frontend, including what role was required, what the userâ€™s role was, and which actions are available instead.

---

## 2. Complete Conditional UI Implementation ðŸŽ¨

**Missing:** Full **role-based UI controls** for all features.

### Code Sample â€” Comprehensive Role-Based UI Helpers

*Add to frontend utilities (e.g., `auth.js` or `permissions.js`)*

```javascript
// Add comprehensive role-based UI helpers
class UIPermissions {
    static canManageLineup(role) {
        return ['manager', 'admin'].includes(role);
    }
    
    static canEditPlayers(role) {
        return ['manager', 'admin'].includes(role);
    }
    
    static canViewStats(role) {
        return ['player', 'manager', 'admin'].includes(role);
    }
}
```

These helpers let the UI conditionally render buttons, links, and panels based on the active userâ€™s role for the selected team.

## 3. Admin Functions for Team Management ðŸ‘¥

**Missing:** **Admin-only endpoints** for team operations such as:

* Add/remove players.
* Promote/demote captains.
* Transfer captain role.

---

## 4. Audit Logging & Security Monitoring ðŸ“Š

**Missing:** **Security audit trail** for sensitive operations such as:

* Lineup changes.
* Role changes.
* Player adds/removals.

---

## 5. Session Management & Token Refresh ðŸ”„

**Missing:** Automatic **token refresh** and **session management** to reduce user friction.

---

## 6. Role Transition Handling ðŸ”„

**Missing:** Handling when user roles change (**promotion/demotion**) to update UI and cached memberships gracefully.

---

# Priority Implementation Plan

### ðŸ”´ High Priority (Complete authorization core)

* Enhanced **403 error responses** with actionable feedback.
* Complete **conditional UI** for all team features.
* **Admin team management functions** (add/remove players, change roles).

### ðŸŸ¡ Medium Priority (Security & UX)

* **Audit logging** for security-sensitive operations.
* **Token refresh mechanism** for seamless UX.
* **Role transition handling** with proper notifications.

### ðŸŸ¢ Low Priority (Polish & Monitoring)

* **Performance monitoring** for authorization checks.
* **Bulk operations** for admin efficiency.
* **Advanced permission matrix** for complex scenarios.

---

# Next Steps Recommendation

Since the **core authorization system is working**, the focus should shift to:

1. **Test the current implementation** thoroughly with different roles.
2. **Implement enhanced error handling** for better UX.
3. **Add missing admin functions** for complete team management.
4. **Complete conditional UI** for all features.

---

ðŸ‘‰ With the added code samples, your developers now have concrete starting points for **403 error responses** and **role-based UI helpers**.

Would you like me to also draft example **admin-only function stubs** (e.g., `POST /teams/{teamId}/members/add`) to round out the missing pieces?
