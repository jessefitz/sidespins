# Quickstart â€“ Match Management (Integrated MVP)

_Migrated from `specs/001-captain-match-management/quickstart.md` on 2025-09-21._

This guide helps you exercise the enhanced match management API endpoints (extending existing `MatchesFunctions` / `LeagueService`) locally with the Azure Functions backend and Jekyll frontend.

Feature Directory: `specs/001-match-management` (renamed from `specs/001-captain-match-management`).

Note: Existing TeamMatch `lineupPlan` (skill cap planning, availability, alternates) is preserved unchanged; new PlayerMatch/Game persistence is additive.

(Original quickstart content retained verbatim for parity with legacy file; update here going forward.)
