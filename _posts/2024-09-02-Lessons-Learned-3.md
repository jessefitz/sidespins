excerpt: "Your intuition is talking to you."
---

Startup founders have a responsibility to trust their gut. This means they need to listen to their intuition, even when everyone around them is pointing to conventional wisdom and pointing to the ample materials out there supporting those conventions*. While external advice can be valuable, a founder's instinct is often shaped by a deeper, more personal understanding of their unique situation.  The experience establishing and growing this journey is uniquely their own.

This responsibility to trust one's intuition extends beyond just the founder — it applies to the entire team. Founders have the responsibility to create and nurture an environment where team members feel comfortable sharing their thoughts, concerns, ideas, and everything in between. By fostering a culture of open communication and trust, the team becomes stronger and more aligned.

When team members are encouraged to express their instincts and perspectives, the startup benefits from a richer diversity of ideas and insights. This collective input helps the team achieve a common understanding and commitment, which are essential for paving the path to growth and success. In the end, a team that trusts each other and feels empowered to share their instincts will navigate challenges more effectively and drive the startup forward with greater confidence and purpose.
