# Fall Session 8 Ball Tournament

APA Division 033 is organizing an 8-ball Tournament.  Time and date have yet to be settled. We're first working to gather a list of people interested in participating.  

As of 11/23/2024, we've had more than 10 people express interest.  We're hoping to drum up more volunteers, so please use the form below to signup.

This page will be updated with more information as it becomes available!
