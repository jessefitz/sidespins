**a·loof**

*/əˈlo͞of/*

*adjective: not friendly or forthcoming; cool and distant.*


I didn't leave a message.  I didn't even call.  I thought about it all day. It woke me in the middle of the night and I lay there for hours thinking about it.  I'll think about it more tomorrow.  It will grip me like a snare pulled tight and tangled around everything.
