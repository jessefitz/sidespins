# Implementation Plan: Match Management (Captain Enhancements Integration)

**Branch**: `001-match-management` | **Date**: 2025-09-20 (updated 2025-09-21) | **Spec**: `spec.md`
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-match-management/spec.md` (directory will be renamed; references updated)

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)

(Documentation of executed steps – Phases 0 & 1 complete.)

```text
1. Load feature spec from Input path → OK
2. Fill Technical Context → OK (no unresolved NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
3. Constitution Check → Placeholder constitution; no violations logged
4. Evaluate Constitution Check → PASS initial
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md generated
6. Execute Phase 1 → data-model.md, contracts/endpoints.md, quickstart.md generated
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check → No new violations (PASS)
8. Plan Phase 2 strategy (below)
9. STOP
```

**IMPORTANT**: Task generation (Phase 2) will be produced separately; this plan only describes approach.

## Summary

Enhance existing `MatchesFunctions` and `LeagueService` with nested PlayerMatch and Game operations plus explicit team score fields while preserving backward compatibility. We are NOT creating a separate `CaptainMatchesFunctions`; this avoids duplicated CRUD/auth logic. MVP frontend remains read-only (list + detail). Data stays in the existing `TeamMatches` Cosmos container (pk `/divisionId`) using transactional batches for score consistency; queries for team lists remain division-partition scoped.

LineupPlan Continuity: All existing lineup planning and availability features (the `lineupPlan` object embedded in TeamMatch) remain untouched; no schema or behavioral change. New nested PlayerMatch/Game storage augments result tracking only.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: C# / .NET 8 (Azure Functions isolated) + Static HTML/JS (Jekyll)  
**Primary Dependencies**: Azure Functions, Azure Cosmos DB SDK, Newtonsoft.Json, existing auth middleware  
**Storage**: Azure Cosmos DB (existing container `TeamMatches`, pk `/divisionId`)
**Testing**: Existing PowerShell + potential xUnit additions (future)  
**Target Platform**: Azure Functions (Consumption or Premium) / Local emulator  
**Project Type**: Web (backend API + static frontend)  
**Performance Goals**: Low-volume league usage (< 100 matches/week initially) – latency < 250ms p95 for list & create  
**Constraints**: Simplicity, minimal validation, last-write-wins; avoid premature multi-container design  
**Scale/Scope**: MVP modest; design leaves path for seasons, audit, external sync  
**Structure Decision**: Option 2 (web application) conceptually, but repository already organized (Functions + docs). No new top-level restructuring required.

### Authentication & Authorization Strategy

We retain a dual-layer approach already present in the codebase:

1. API Secret (`x-api-secret`) – lightweight shared secret primarily for:

- Internal tooling & bulk data scripts (imports, migrations)
- Local/manual testing without user session bootstrap
- CI/CD smoke checks

1. JWT (Stytch-issued) – end-user (captain/player) identity & role context enabling:

- Role/claim evaluation (e.g., captain rights, future division restrictions)
- Team membership validation via existing membership service

Planned enforcement for new endpoints:

| Endpoint Category | Read (GET) MVP | Mutations (POST/PATCH/DELETE) MVP | Future Tightening |
|-------------------|----------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------|
| TeamMatch list/detail | Accept API secret OR JWT (either) | JWT required (captain / admin); API secret allowed only in dev/bulk mode flag | Drop API secret for prod except flagged maintenance mode |
| PlayerMatch ops | JWT required (captain/admin); API secret allowed for scripts | JWT required; API secret via maintenance flag | Enforce role hierarchy, disallow secret |
| Game record ops | JWT required (captain/admin) | JWT required | Potential per-rack audit events |

Implementation Notes:

- Introduce a new attribute (e.g., `AllowApiSecretAttribute`) that short-circuits at middleware if API secret header is valid for endpoints where anonymous maintenance is acceptable.
- Existing `RequireAuthenticationAttribute` continues to gate user context endpoints (mutations) – we will annotate create/update/delete endpoints accordingly.
- Middleware extension: If no JWT but API secret present and endpoint allows secret, proceed with limited principal (no UserId claims) and skip membership checks.
- Logging must clearly flag secret-based access vs user-based to aid auditing.
- Add configuration toggle `DISABLE_API_SECRET_MUTATIONS` to hard disable secret writes in higher environments.

Risk Mitigations:

- Secret Rotation: Document rotation procedure (update Key Vault / config + redeploy) before feature GA.
- Abuse Detection: Add Application Insights custom event for secret-based mutation usage count.
- Future Deprecation: Once stable, restrict secret to read-only + bulk import function set.

Task Impacts (Phase 2 additions):

- Add middleware branch for dual auth acceptance with endpoint-level opt-in.
- Add tests: (a) secret-only read list allowed (b) secret-only create rejected when flag disabled (c) JWT captain create succeeds.
- Add doc updates in `quickstart.md` showing JWT vs API secret flows.

## Constitution Check

Constitution file is largely placeholder; no explicit prohibitions triggered. Simplicity adhered to: single container, no repository pattern layer added, minimal validation. No complexity deviations requiring justification.

## Project Structure

(Existing repo preserved – only documentation added under feature directory.)

### Documentation (this feature)

### Source Impact (planned)

```text
functions/league/
  MatchesFunctions.cs      # extended: add PlayerMatch/Game routes
  LeagueService.cs         # extended: AddPlayerMatchAsync, AddGameAsync, RecomputeTeamMatchScoresAsync
  LeagueModels.cs          # add PlayerMatch, Game, new TeamMatch fields (teamScoreHome/Away, externalLeagueMatchId)
  (optional) ScoreRecompute.cs  # extracted recompute logic if complexity warrants
```
 
No frontend source reorg; Jekyll page addition optional (e.g., matches.html) consuming list endpoint.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research (Completed)

Decisions stored in `research.md`; all unknowns either resolved or explicitly deferred (seasons, role claims, APA external IDs).

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts (Completed)

- Schemas finalized (`data-model.md`).
- REST endpoint contracts defined (`contracts/endpoints.md`).
- Quickstart prepared for local manual verification (`quickstart.md`).
- No agent-specific file update required beyond existing Copilot instructions.

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach (To Be Executed by /tasks)

**Task Generation Strategy**:

- Each endpoint → contract test + implementation pair.
- Each entity → model + DTO + mapper (if needed) tasks.
- Batch operations → explicit transactional batch helper task.
- Score recompute → service method with unit test skeleton.
- Quickstart flows → integration test scenario tasks (create match, add player match, add games, list, detail).

**Ordering Strategy**:

1. Models & DTO definitions
2. Service logic (score recompute, batch helpers)
3. Endpoint skeletons (return 501) + contract tests (failing)
4. Implement create flows (TeamMatch, PlayerMatch, Game)
5. Implement query endpoints (list, get)
6. Patch / Delete (if included) last
7. Frontend read-only page integration (optional MVP-FE)

**Parallelization ([P])**: Model creation, Game endpoint after PlayerMatch, list & get endpoints can proceed parallel once models exist.

**Estimated Task Count**: ~24 tasks (models, service, 7–8 endpoints, tests, docs updates).

## Frontend Browsing & UX (Gap Filled)

MVP previously scoped backend only; we add a minimal read-only browsing experience so captains (and potentially general users) can view recent matches for a team and drill into player match + rack detail. Follows existing styling/structure from `docs/lineup-explorer-new.html` (utility CSS classes, responsive container, accessible controls).

### Pages / Components

1. `docs/matches.html` – Team match list view

  Query parameters: `?divisionId=DIV123&teamId=TEAM_A`  
  Fetch: `GET /api/divisions/{divisionId}/teams/{teamId}/team-matches?limit=25`  
  Render: table (date, opponent, score, link to detail)  
  Pagination: "Load more" button using continuationToken

1. `docs/match-detail.html` – Single match detail

  Query param: `?id=<teamMatchId>` (and `divisionId` to ensure partition context)  
  Fetch base match: `GET /api/team-matches/{id}`  
  Player matches: parallel `GET /api/player-matches/{playerMatchId}` (future aggregated endpoint)  
  Games: `GET /api/player-matches/{playerMatchId}/games` per player match  
  UI: collapsible sections per player match (summary row + expandable rack list)

### Client Module

`docs/assets/js/matches.js` (new):

- `fetchWithSecret(path)` centralizing header injection (API secret for now; future token injection hook placeholder)
- `loadMatchList(divisionId, teamId)` returns { items, continuationToken }
- `renderMatchList(container, items)` builds rows with accessible markup
- `loadMatchDetail(teamMatchId, divisionId)` orchestrates child fetches with Promise.all
- `renderMatchDetail(container, model)` outputs structured sections (ARIA roles for accordion of player matches)

### Accessibility & Usability

- Use `<table>` for match list with `<thead>` + `<tbody>` for screen reader clarity.
- Accordion: `<button aria-expanded>` controlling `<div role="region" aria-labelledby>` for player match sections.
- Loading state: skeleton or text `Loading…` with `aria-live="polite"` region.
- Error handling: display toast-like alert `<div role="alert">`.

### Performance Considerations (Frontend Browsing)

- Limit parallel fetch fan-out: throttle player match + game fetches (e.g., sequential for now; optimize later).
- Cache previously fetched player match/game data in an in-memory map to avoid duplicate requests when toggling accordion.
- Defer games load until a player match is expanded (lazy loading) to reduce initial payload pressure (progressive disclosure).

### Security & Auth Evolution

- All current calls use `x-api-secret` header; code isolates header injection to one function for easy refactor to JWT.
- Provide TODO comment: "Replace secret header with bearer token when JWT flows enabled".

### Error / Edge Cases

- Missing query params → show configuration form (inputs for divisionId, teamId) and persist recent selections in `localStorage`.
- Empty list: show neutral CTA "No matches recorded yet".
- Network failure: retry button (simple exponential backoff attempt count capped at 3).

### Deferred (Not MVP)

- Combined aggregated endpoint reducing N+1 fetches.
- Client-side filtering by date range.
- Sorting toggles (date ascending, opponent, score diff).
- Offline caching/service worker.

### Frontend Task Impact

Will add tasks T039+ (see extension to tasks.md) covering page scaffolding, JS module, lazy load logic, accessibility audit, and documentation updates (quickstart frontend usage snippet).

### Endpoint Authentication Annotation Plan

| Endpoint | Method | Auth Attribute | Allow API Secret? | Notes |
|----------|--------|----------------|-------------------|-------|
| Create TeamMatch | POST /team-matches | RequireAuthentication(player) | Transitional (flag) | Secret allowed only if `DISABLE_API_SECRET_MUTATIONS` false |
| List Team Matches | GET /divisions/{divisionId}/teams/{teamId}/team-matches | (None) + AllowApiSecret | Yes | Read path: secret OR JWT |
| Get TeamMatch | GET /team-matches/{id} | (None) + AllowApiSecret | Yes | May return limited fields if secret only (future) |
| Delete TeamMatch | DELETE /team-matches/{id} | RequireAuthentication(captain) | No | Optional MVP; if added, JWT only |
| Add PlayerMatch | POST /team-matches/{id}/player-matches | RequireAuthentication(captain) | Transitional (flag) | Secret path for bulk backfill only |
| Get PlayerMatch | GET /player-matches/{id} | (None) + AllowApiSecret | Yes | Read-only |
| Patch PlayerMatch | PATCH /player-matches/{id} | RequireAuthentication(captain) | No | Points/score corrections require identity |
| Add Game | POST /player-matches/{id}/games | RequireAuthentication(captain) | Transitional (flag) | Script inserts for migration allowed |
| List Games | GET /player-matches/{id}/games | (None) + AllowApiSecret | Yes | Read-only |

Implementation Steps:

1. Introduce `AllowApiSecretAttribute` (no params) used to mark read endpoints.
2. Extend middleware: if endpoint has AllowApiSecretAttribute and header secret matches configuration, bypass JWT requirement (inject limited principal context with `AuthMode=ApiSecret`).
3. Add environment flag enforcement: if a mutation endpoint is called without JWT and secret present, allow only when `ALLOW_SECRET_MUTATIONS=true` and log warning.
4. Add structured logging fields: `authMode`, `userId` (or null), `endpoint`.
5. Add integration tests for dual-mode scenarios.

## Phase 3+: Future (Out of Scope Here)

- Aggregated full-detail endpoint
- Role-based auth enforcement
- Validation rules (skill cap, lineup order uniqueness)
- Audit/event sourcing
- External APA synchronization

## Security Considerations

| Concern | Scenario | Impact | Mitigation (MVP) | Future Hardening |
|---------|----------|--------|------------------|------------------|
| Shared secret misuse | Leaked `x-api-secret` used for writes | Unauthorized bulk mutations | Env flag `ALLOW_SECRET_MUTATIONS`; log authMode; minimal allowed set | Remove secret write path; IP allow-list for maintenance tools |
| Replay of game posts | Captured request resent | Duplicate or inflated scores | ULID ids generated server-side; idempotency future | Idempotency keys + hash of rack composite |
| Privilege escalation | Secret bypasses role checks | Role-based restrictions ineffective | Secret cannot access endpoints with `RequireAuthenticationAttribute` unless flag set | Remove transitional flag; enforce JWT only for mutations |
| Score drift | Partial batch failure not noticed | Incorrect standings | Transactional batch + recompute centralization | Periodic reconciliation job + telemetry alert |
| Secret rotation lag | Old secret still accepted | Extended exposure window | Only single active secret in config | Dual-secret rotation window + auto-expiry |
| Data tampering | Malicious captain edits historical games | Integrity concerns | Minimal patch endpoints; audit deferred | Append-only event log; cryptographic hash chain |

Additional Notes:

- All structured logs should include: `authMode`, `divisionId`, `teamMatchId` (when present), elapsed ms.

## Scoring & Aggregate Recompute (Point-Based Model)

### Goals

Provide a flexible scoring layer supporting:

- 8-ball style (rack win counts only)
- 9-ball style (per-rack points accumulation; winner optional)
- Future hybrid or alternative league formats without schema churn

### Data Signals

- Game documents now carry `pointsHome`, `pointsAway`, optional `winner`.
- PlayerMatch accumulates `pointsHome/pointsAway` and legacy `gamesWon*`.
- TeamMatch aggregates teamScoreHome/teamScoreAway derived from PlayerMatch (points-first, fallback to gamesWon totals if all points zero).

### Recompute Algorithm (Pseudo)

```text
For each PlayerMatch affected:
  Fetch all Game docs (or incrementally update with delta):
    sumPointsHome = Σ pointsHome
    sumPointsAway = Σ pointsAway
    if winner present per game -> increment tempGamesWon counters
  Update PlayerMatch:
    pointsHome = sumPointsHome
    pointsAway = sumPointsAway
    if any game has points > 0:
       gamesWon* remain (optional) but not used for aggregates unless points all zero
    totalRacks = count(games)
After all PlayerMatches for TeamMatch recomputed:
  if any PlayerMatch.pointsHome+pointsAway > 0:
     teamScoreHome = Σ PlayerMatch.pointsHome
     teamScoreAway = Σ PlayerMatch.pointsAway
  else:
     teamScoreHome = Σ PlayerMatch.gamesWonHome
     teamScoreAway = Σ PlayerMatch.gamesWonAway
```

### Performance Considerations

- Incremental path: when adding a single Game, derive deltas instead of full scan (reads PlayerMatch current totals, adds new Game points, updates). Full scan reserved for reconciliation script.
- RU Control: Keep per-player game counts small (<=9 racks typical) → low cost to rescan if needed.

### Extensibility Hooks

- Introduce `format` field (future) on TeamMatch (e.g., `eight_ball`, `nine_ball`) controlling validation & scoring policy selection.
- Scoring service interface (e.g., `IScoringStrategy`) allowing new point or handicap systems without schema changes.

### Edge Cases

- Mixed legacy games (some with points, some only winner): treat any presence of points as authority; derive missing points as 1 per rack only if a future migration decides (not MVP).
- Negative or huge point values rejected at validation.

### Testing Strategy

- Unit tests: (a) pure points matches, (b) legacy gamesWon only, (c) mixed set, (d) zero-point racks.
- Integration: create match → add games incrementally → confirm cumulative team score trajectory.
- Add an Application Insights KQL workbook for monitoring secret-based access volume.
